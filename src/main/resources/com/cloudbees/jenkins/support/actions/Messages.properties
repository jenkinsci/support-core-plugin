  In order to assist the Jenkins community to provide you with a response to your issues please consider generating \
  a bundle of the commonly requested information and consider attaching this bundle to the corresponding issue in \
  the Jenkins community issue tracker. Be mindful that attachments to the Jenkins community issue tracker are public \
  so be extra careful not to include sensitive information. Note that certain metadata can be automatically \
  anonymized when support bundle anonymization is enabled through the global configuration settings. \
  When anonymization is enabled, the following information is replaced with automatically generated anonymized names: \
  nodes, computers, labels, users, items (including jobs), views, and IP addresses.
