  some of the information due to corporate policy, you can either deselect the information to exclude prior to \
  generating the bundle or edit the generated bundle to remove the specific information that you must exclude. \
  Each bundle is a simple ZIP file containing mostly plain text files and you can examine and/or modify the bundle \
  prior to sharing the bundle if you have any concerns about the information contained within.
