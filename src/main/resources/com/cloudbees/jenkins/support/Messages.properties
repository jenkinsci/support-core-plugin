  the Jenkins community issue tracker. Be mindful that attachments to the Jenkins community issue tracker are public \
  so be extra careful not to include sensitive information. Note that certain metadata can be automatically \
  anonymized when support bundle anonymization is enabled through the global configuration settings. \
